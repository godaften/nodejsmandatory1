  <h2>Plain vs Bootstrap</h2>
  <p>
  So, plain CSS. It's great. It takes a long time and you probably end up with a lot of confusing class names and a lousy structure - 
  depending only on your discipline and experience AND if you work alone and can maintain the discipline OR 
  if working with other you all can keep the discipline and consistency. I doubt it ;)
  </p>
  <p>So far in my life I've used only plain CSS - 
    mainly because I've used Wordpress for everything and most of the CSS is done behind the scene with page builders.</p>
    <p>This time I've made a website "from the ground" and suddenly using a CSS Framework made sense.
      When using Bootstrap you can very quickly make a nice website. 
      Simply connect your html and javascript to bootstrap - or import it all to your project. 
      Here I've just added two lines of code to be able to use Boostrap. Very easy.</p>
    <p>Now I can simply add predefined classes to my html and it will be styled the Bootstrap way.
    </p>
    <p>In this project I've made some custom classes, eg. different spacer divs to easyli add margin beetween divs.
      Also I made a reset of all padding and margin so it's easier to control. The main styling is done with Bootstrap.
