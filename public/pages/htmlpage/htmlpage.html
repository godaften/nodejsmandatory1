    The website is build in a sandwich structure with a nav html file containing the head, 
    start body tag and the navbar, a footer file with the end body tag and footer info. 
    The inside of the sandwich is all the pages. It's a nice way to build a website. 
    In the app.js file everything is connected to make the magic happen.
