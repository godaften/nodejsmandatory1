    <h2>The Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Is the Assignment to mention everything? To go through everything we've learned?
        Or is it to show that we can make a website - one that potentionally could contain it all?
        To me the latter must be the task. 
        If wanted we can use it further on to hold all notes and have one place to find it all.

    <h3>So what have I done?</h3>
    <p>
        I've made a responsive website in NodeJS using Express and Bootstrap with 5 pages, a navbar and a footer.
        It's my first time using a CSS framework. I've been wanting to try Bootstrap for years, but I just haven't gotten to it.
        Now was a good time. It's been quite fun and something I'm gonna use again when building and testing a small app where the
        design doesn't need to be to custom.
    </p>
    <p>I've also looked at Tailwind. It's more of a library with a lot of css classes ready to use for everything.
        It takes longer to build up a page with Tailwind than Bootstrap, but it's much more customizable and still 
        much faster than plain CSS plus you get a perfect consistent class structure. Very nice.
    </p>
    <p>Feel free to look around, but
    don't get your expectations to high up regarding finding every peace of info - we've got Google and Statckoverflow for that :)</p>
