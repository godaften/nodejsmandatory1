    <h2>The Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Is the Assignment to mention everything? To go through everything we've learned?
        Or is it to show that we can make a website - one that potentionally could contain it all?
        To me the latter is the task. I keep all my notes elsewhere and making 
        a big website isn't exotic to me since I've been a webdesigner for +7 years. 
        The fun and educational part was to make a working website from the ground using NodeJS and what we've learned so far.
    </p>
    <h3>So what have I done?</h3>
    <p>
        I've made a responsive website in NodeJS using Express and Bootstrap with 5 pages, a navbar and a footer.
        I have:
        <ul class="ul-ml">
            <li>made a website with NodeJS and ExpressJS</li>
            <li>inserted images on a page</li>
            <li>used codeblocks in different colors to show terminal commands and code </li>
            <li>used a CSS Framework to easyli and consistently style the website and make it responsive</li>
            <li>used custom CSS</li>
            <li>made a sticky footer</li>
            <li>and more</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        <p>
        It's my first time using a CSS framework.
        Working with Wordpress and pagebuilders in many years, it hasn't been relevant, 
        but I've been wanting to try Bootstrap for years.
        Now was a good time. It's been fun and something I'm gonna use again when building and testing a small app where the
        design doesn't need to be to custom.
    </p>
    <p>I've also looked at Tailwind. It's more of a library with a lot of css classes ready to use for everything.
        It takes longer to build up a page with Tailwind than Bootstrap, but it's much more customizable and still 
        much faster than plain CSS plus you get a perfect consistent class structure. Very nice.
    </p>
    <p>Feel free to look around, but
    don't get your expectations to high up regarding finding every peace of info - we've got Google and Statckoverflow for that :)
